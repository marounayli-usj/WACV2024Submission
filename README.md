# WACV2024Submission

This repo is for the submisson ID: 2544 - SeleniumSight : an Object Detection Agent for UI Testing Automation

The script betterFarmer.py is responsible to collect and annotate screenshots from the Wikipedia Website in the yolov8 format.

You can download the Sight pretrained model in the PyTorch format from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EaPz-7LgAOQF_2ui-D1YKmLl2XJo-bjd/view?usp=sharing)

The script inference.py combines the power of Selenium and Sight and PaddleOCR to convert detect objects into web element objects and to interact with them using selenium.
